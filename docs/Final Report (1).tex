\section*{1. Introduction}

Over the past few years, spatial transcriptomics has fundamentally reshaped how we study gene expression by introducing the critical dimension of spatial context. Instead of analyzing cells in isolation, we can now investigate how they behave within the architecture of tissue—offering insights into tissue heterogeneity, microenvironmental interactions, and spatially driven gene regulation. Platforms such as MERFISH, Slide-seq, and 10x Genomics' Visium have made it feasible to profile gene expression at unprecedented scale and resolution, providing high-dimensional spatial maps of biological tissues \cite{chen2015merfish,rodriques2019slideseq,10xvisium}.

As the data becomes richer, the challenge shifts toward building models that can extract meaningful biological insights from both expression levels and spatial structure. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction in this space because of their natural ability to model relational data \cite{spagcn}. In spatial transcriptomics, it makes intuitive sense to represent cells as nodes and construct graphs based on spatial proximity or transcriptional similarity. Through message passing, GNNs can learn features that reflect interactions within a cell's local neighborhood. However, this very strength becomes a limitation—traditional GNNs often operate with fixed-hop neighborhoods, which restrict their ability to model long-range or global dependencies that might exist across a tissue section. As a result, important patterns across distant regions of the tissue may go unnoticed.

To overcome this bottleneck, some models have attempted to integrate additional modalities or expand graph structure, with SpaGCN being a widely referenced approach \cite{spagcn}. SpaGCN combines spatial coordinates and gene expression into a single graph structure and applies graph convolution to extract spatial features. While this is a step in the right direction, SpaGCN still relies on a static graph and limited aggregation depth, which means it struggles to adaptively learn long-range, context-aware interactions that may be critical for tasks like cell-type classification.

In this work, we propose \textbf{SpatialTransformerGNN} a hybrid architecture that augments the traditional GNN framework with transformer-based attention mechanisms. Inspired by recent progress in graph attention and spatial transcriptomics modeling \cite{stagate}, this model incorporates multi-head self-attention layers into a bilevel GNN architecture. The goal is to combine the strengths of both paradigms: GNNs for encoding local structure and transformers for capturing global, non-local dependencies across the tissue. By learning adaptive attention weights, SpatialTransformerGNN can move beyond rigid, neighborhood-based interactions and instead model the tissue environment in a more holistic way.

The motivation behind this research lies in the growing recognition that biological interactions do not always follow spatial proximity. Cells often coordinate behavior across tissue-wide gradients or signaling pathways that are spatially non-contiguous. As spatial omics data becomes more complex and higher resolution, we need models that are capable of capturing both fine-grained local structure and broader, tissue-level organization. SpatialTransformerGNN is designed to meet that need.

This paper is guided by the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To develop a transformer-augmented GNN that can learn flexible, data-driven spatial relationships.
  \item To validate this architecture using the large-scale Zhuang-ABCA-1 MERFISH dataset, which includes over 2.8 million single-cell profiles.
  \item To benchmark our model against existing approaches such as SpaGCN, focusing not just on classification performance but also on the interpretability and biological validity of learned spatial patterns.
\end{itemize}

In summary, our contributions are threefold:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We present a new architecture that combines message passing with transformer attention to better model long-range dependencies in spatial transcriptomics data.
  \item We introduce a contrastive learning strategy that improves class separation in the model's latent space, making it easier to interpret.
  \item We demonstrate that this approach leads to improvements in classification accuracy and provides biologically meaningful insights that surpass current baselines.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review relevant literature on spatial transcriptomics and graph-based learning models. Section 3 introduces the design and theoretical underpinnings of SpatialTransformerGNN. Section 4 details the dataset and preprocessing pipeline. Section 5 presents empirical results and evaluation metrics. In Section 6, we discuss the biological significance of the learned representations, and Section 7 outlines conclusions and future directions.

\section*{2. Related Work}

The integration of spatial and transcriptomic information has led to the development of numerous computational models tailored to understanding cellular heterogeneity in tissue contexts. Spatial transcriptomics technologies such as MERFISH, Slide-seq, and 10x Visium have enabled the capture of both gene expression and spatial location, prompting the emergence of graph-based modeling approaches that aim to uncover spatial patterns and domain structures. This section presents a comprehensive review of prior work related to spatially informed modeling, graph neural networks, and the application of attention mechanisms, highlighting their limitations and the motivations behind the proposed SpatialTransformerGNN.

\subsection*{2.1 Graph Neural Networks in Spatial Transcriptomics}
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach for modeling cell-to-cell relationships by representing cells as nodes and using gene expression or spatial proximity to define edges. One of the earliest and widely used models is \textbf{SpaGCN} \cite{spagcn}, which constructs a spatial graph by integrating gene expression profiles with histological and spatial location data. SpaGCN applies convolution operations over the constructed graph to infer spatial domains and perform clustering. However, SpaGCN relies on a fixed and static graph, which limits its flexibility in adapting to complex or non-local dependencies. It assumes that spatial proximity is the sole determinant of cellular relationships, which may not be the case in tissues where transcriptional similarity exists across distant regions.

Another method, \textbf{scBiGNN} \cite{scbignn}, extends the capabilities of GCNs by introducing cell-wise attention and enabling edge-level interpretability. scBiGNN constructs an attention-enhanced bipartite graph between cells and spatial features, allowing for a more flexible learning of spatial structures. While this model shows improved clustering and interpretability, it still suffers from the core limitation of local message passing. The reliance on static graph topology and fixed-hop neighborhoods restricts its capability to model dynamic and high-order intercellular relationships.

\subsection*{2.2 Limitations of Existing Spatial Models}
Despite the innovative integration of graph theory with spatial transcriptomics, the existing GNN-based models typically exhibit two critical limitations: (1) \textbf{Locality Constraints}, wherein the model’s receptive field is limited to immediate or nearby neighbors, and (2) \textbf{Static Graph Construction}, where relationships are pre-defined and do not evolve during learning. These limitations hinder the models’ ability to generalize in tissues with complex spatial arrangements or where cells influence others beyond immediate proximity. In biological systems, long-range signaling pathways, tissue gradients, and developmental cues often imply relationships that are not purely local.

Moreover, these models often ignore the rich hierarchical and multi-scale nature of spatial data. For example, a cell’s transcriptional profile may be influenced by global spatial domains, tissue microenvironments, or region-specific signaling gradients, which require reasoning beyond simple Euclidean distance-based graphs.

\subsection*{2.3 Transformer Models in Machine Learning}
Transformers, initially introduced in the context of natural language processing by Vaswani et al. \cite{vaswani2017attention}, have revolutionized sequence modeling through the use of self-attention. Unlike convolutional and recurrent models, transformers can model global dependencies and capture contextual information without relying on local kernels or memory states. The self-attention mechanism computes dynamic pairwise interactions, allowing each token to attend to all others based on learned similarity.

This flexibility has led to the widespread adoption of transformers in computer vision (e.g., Vision Transformer), protein folding (e.g., AlphaFold), and increasingly in biomedical data science. Their ability to learn high-level, context-aware representations makes them especially suitable for spatial data, where relationships are neither uniformly distributed nor bounded by fixed proximity.

\subsection*{2.4 Hybrid Architectures: Combining GNNs and Transformers}
Recognizing the complementary strengths of GNNs and transformers, researchers have begun exploring \textbf{hybrid architectures} that incorporate both local and global reasoning. For instance, \textbf{Graphormer} \cite{ying2021graphormer} introduces a transformer-based model for graph-level tasks by encoding positional and edge information into the attention mechanism. Similarly, \textbf{GTN} and \textbf{Graph-BERT} propose methods for structural encoding and context-aware attention in graph domains.

While these models offer promising pathways for graph-based global reasoning, they are often designed for general-purpose graphs (e.g., molecules, social networks) and are not optimized for spatial omics datasets. These datasets pose unique challenges such as irregular graph density, variable spatial scales, and domain-specific topological patterns that general graph transformers may not fully capture.

\subsection*{2.5 Summary and Positioning of Our Work}
In summary, while SpaGCN and scBiGNN represent significant progress in spatial modeling, they fall short in capturing dynamic, high-order dependencies due to their static graph structures and limited receptive fields. Transformer-based models offer global reasoning capabilities but lack the domain-specific inductive biases that GNNs bring to spatial modeling.

Our work addresses this gap by proposing \textbf{Spatial\-Transformer\-GNN}, a novel bilevel hybrid architecture that embeds transformer attention within GNN blocks. This model is specifically designed to learn both local neighborhood interactions and long-range spatial dependencies by dynamically adapting its graph topology through attention-based mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, SpatialTransformerGNN is among the first to apply this level of hybrid reasoning to spatial transcriptomic data at biological scale, combining the strengths of GNN locality with transformer globality.

The remainder of the paper builds on this foundation by introducing our architectural design, experimental setup, and biological implications.


\section{3. Methods}

To address the challenge of spatially informed cell type classification, we designed a \textbf{bilevel neural architecture} that integrates spatial and molecular features into a unified model. Our framework leverages dense positional encoding for spatial representation, a dedicated encoder for gene expression profiles, and a hybrid Transformer-GNN block for effective relational learning.

\subsection{3.1 Spatial Feature Encoding via Dense Positional Embeddings}

We begin by encoding the spatial coordinates $(x, y, [z])$ of each cell using \textbf{dense positional encodings}. Inspired by positional encoding in transformer architectures, these embeddings map raw spatial positions into high-dimensional feature vectors. This transformation preserves relative spatial information and allows the model to learn structural dependencies and microenvironmental contexts within the tissue.

\subsection{3.2 Gene Expression Feature Encoder}

In parallel, we use a dedicated \textbf{gene expression encoder} to process high-dimensional transcriptomic data. This encoder consists of a series of fully connected layers interleaved with batch normalization and non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU). The encoder projects the input gene expression profile into a latent space that retains key biological signals while reducing dimensionality and noise.

\subsection{3.3 Transformer-GNN Hybrid Block}

The outputs from the spatial and expression encoders are concatenated and passed to a core \textbf{Transformer-GNN block}, which comprises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-head self-attention}, enabling the model to learn global dependencies across all cells. This mechanism helps capture complex interactions such as spatial signaling patterns and gene co-expression relationships.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive adjacency learning}, which dynamically constructs a graph structure by learning adjacency relationships during training. Unlike fixed graphs, this method allows the model to learn context-specific topologies, improving its flexibility across varying tissue architectures.
\end{itemize}

This hybrid design combines the strengths of transformers (global context modeling) and graph neural networks (local neighborhood aggregation), allowing for both expressive and structure-aware learning.

\subsection{3.4 Training Objective}

We train the model using a dual-loss objective:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-entropy loss} for supervised classification of cells into known cell types.
    \item \textbf{Contrastive loss} applied to the learned embeddings, which encourages intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the latent space. This helps the model better differentiate between similar or rare cell types.
\end{itemize}

Together, these components form a robust architecture capable of learning discriminative, spatially-informed representations from complex spatial transcriptomics data.

\section{4. Dataset and Preprocessing}

\subsection{4.1 Dataset Overview}

We utilized the \textbf{MERFISH Zhuang-ABCA-1 spatial transcriptomics dataset}, a high-resolution dataset generated using Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH). This dataset includes approximately \textbf{2.8 million single cells}, each with expression values across \textbf{1,122 gene features}. Additionally, it contains expert-curated cluster labels that serve as ground truth for supervised learning. These annotations were produced by histological analysis and domain-specific knowledge, offering a reliable benchmark for evaluating cell-type classification models.

\subsection{4.2 Preprocessing Pipeline}

Due to the dataset’s scale and complexity, we designed a robust preprocessing pipeline to ensure quality, reduce dimensionality, and standardize feature representations for downstream machine learning tasks. The key stages are detailed below:

\subsubsection{Highly Variable Gene (HVG) Selection}

To manage the high dimensionality of gene expression data, we selected the top highly variable genes (HVGs) based on their variance across the entire dataset. This step helps reduce noise by excluding genes with near-constant expression levels and retains features with the greatest discriminatory power for cell-type classification.

\subsubsection{Log Normalization and Scaling}

After HVG filtering, we applied log-normalization to control for differences in total expression per cell. The normalized expression for a gene was computed as:

\[
\text{log-normalized value} = \log_2 \left( \frac{\text{raw count}}{\text{total counts per cell}} \times 10^4 + 1 \right)
\]

This transformation stabilizes the variance and compresses the dynamic range of gene expression values. Subsequently, each gene was scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, standardizing the input space for training deep learning models.

\subsubsection{Cluster Label Encoding}

The dataset includes expert-provided cluster annotations denoting distinct cell types or regions. These labels were encoded as categorical integer indices for use in classification tasks. The resulting labels were compatible with standard loss functions such as cross-entropy, facilitating supervised training of our model.

\subsection{4.3 Data Quality Considerations}

We incorporated several additional quality control steps to ensure dataset integrity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cell filtering}: Cells with low total gene counts or extreme outlier expression patterns were removed.
    \item \textbf{Gene filtering}: Genes expressed in fewer than a threshold number of cells were excluded to minimize background noise.
    \item \textbf{Batch normalization}: Although batch effects were limited, our model includes batch normalization layers to ensure stable feature distributions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4.4 Summary}

The resulting preprocessed dataset represents a biologically grounded and computationally tractable version of the raw MERFISH data. It includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A reduced gene matrix with high-variance genes
    \item Log-normalized and standardized gene expression values
    \item Retained spatial coordinates for each cell
    \item Categorical cluster labels for supervised learning
\end{itemize}

This processed dataset forms the input to our spatially informed neural model and is critical for learning accurate, spatially aware cell-type representations.

\section*{5. Model Architecture}
The architecture consists of four main components: (1) Positional encoding layers for spatial coordinates, (2) Gene feature encoders, (3) Transformer-GNN blocks with multi-head attention, and (4) Contrastive loss. Adaptive adjacency matrices were learned during training, enabling the model to capture both local neighborhoods and distant transcriptional similarities.

  \caption{Transformer-GNN Block: Multi-head self-attention integrated with adaptive adjacency.}
  \label{fig:transformer_gnn_block}
\end{figure}

\section*{6. Objective Function for SpatialTransformerGNN}

We define the total loss function $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}$ for the SpatialTransformerGNN model as a weighted combination of classification loss and graph regularization terms:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{cell-smooth}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{gene-smooth}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{attn-reg}}
\end{equation}

\noindent The individual components are defined as:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Classification Loss (Cross-entropy):}
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{ic} \log(\hat{y}_{ic})
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Cell-Graph Smoothness Loss:}
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{cell-smooth}} = \text{Tr}(H^{\top} L^{\text{cell}} H)
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Gene-Graph Smoothness Loss:}
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{gene-smooth}} = \text{Tr}(G^{\top} L^{\text{gene}} G)
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Attention Regularization (optional):}
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{attn-reg}} = - \sum_{j} \log(a_{ij})
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent where $H$ and $G$ are the embeddings for cells and genes, $L^{\text{cell}}$ and $L^{\text{gene}}$ are the graph Laplacians, and $a_{ij}$ are the transformer attention weights.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Explanation of Core Components:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positional Encoding:} The spatial coordinates $(x, y, z)$ of each cell are projected into a higher-dimensional space using fully connected (dense) layers. This allows the model to learn complex spatial patterns, enabling it to capture physical proximity and structural arrangements in the tissue.

    \item \textbf{Feature Encoder:} Gene expression profiles are passed through a dense layer that performs dimension reduction and abstraction. This produces a meaningful and compact representation of gene activity, which can be fused with spatial information for downstream learning.

    \item \textbf{Transformer-GNN Blocks:} These core units integrate:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Multi-head self-attention:} Each cell can attend to every other cell, regardless of spatial distance, enabling global context awareness.
        \item \textbf{Adaptive adjacency learning:} Rather than using a fixed graph, the model learns the relational structure dynamically, allowing it to adapt to diverse spatial and transcriptional environments.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Contrastive Loss:} Applied on the latent representations to improve feature separability. Positive pairs (cells from the same type) are pulled closer, while negative pairs (cells from different types) are pushed apart. This enhances the clustering of latent features by cell identity.
\end{itemize}
\section*{7. Model Evaluation and Preliminary Comparison}

To evaluate the performance of the SpatialTransformerGNN, we conducted initial experiments using a representative subset of the MERFISH Zhuang-ABCA-1 dataset. While the complete dataset consists of over 2.8 million spatially resolved single cells and 1,122 gene features, we used a \textbf{random subset of 20,000 cells} for early-stage model development and validation.

On this subset, the model achieved a \textbf{test accuracy of 36.07\%} and a \textbf{Top-3 accuracy of 61.80\%}. These results indicate the model’s robustness in handling noisy, high-dimensional, and highly imbalanced biological data where subtle variations in gene expression may represent functionally distinct cell types. The Top-3 metric is particularly valuable in biological settings, where providing a shortlist of probable cell identities may be sufficient to assist expert interpretation or downstream analysis.

It should be noted that our sampling approach did not yet incorporate stratified or biologically informed sampling techniques. Although random subsampling was practical during model prototyping, it may underrepresent rare cell types and disrupt spatial structures intrinsic to tissue biology. In future work, we plan to adopt \textbf{stratified or spatially balanced sampling strategies} to preserve both molecular and spatial heterogeneity \cite{luecken2022benchmarking}.

\subsection*{7.1 Adjacency and Attention Visualization}

To better understand the internal structure learned by the model, we analyzed both fixed and learned adjacency strategies using randomly selected subsets of the data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fixed Adjacency:} A $k=6$ nearest-neighbor graph was constructed based on spatial proximity. This enforces strict local connectivity, capturing spatial neighborhoods but ignoring transcriptional similarity. As a result, biologically similar cells that are spatially distant remain disconnected, limiting the graph's ability to model long-range interactions.
    
    \item \textbf{Learned Adjacency:} The model dynamically inferred adjacency relationships using both spatial and expression features. This allows the construction of non-local connections between functionally similar cells regardless of their physical proximity. For instance, connections between transcriptionally related cells such as cell 96 and cell 24—despite being spatially distant—were recovered in the learned graph.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:matrix-output} compares the adjacency matrices produced under each strategy. The learned matrix highlights clusters of functionally coherent cells that are missed by the spatially constrained fixed graph. This supports the model's capability to discover biologically meaningful groupings that are not solely dictated by spatial location.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/Figure4.png}
\caption{Comparison of adjacency strategies. Left: Fixed $k=6$ adjacency matrix reflecting local spatial neighborhoods. Right: Learned adjacency matrix uncovering long-range biological relationships, such as the link between transcriptionally similar cells 96 and 24.}
\label{fig:matrix-output}
\end{figure}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/Figure5.png}
\caption{Attention heatmap from a transformer head. Brighter regions indicate higher attention weights between distant yet functionally related cells.}
\label{fig:attention-map}
\end{figure}

In addition, we visualized attention scores from the transformer layers. Figure~\ref{fig:attention-map} shows an attention heatmap derived from subsampled data. These attention weights help interpret how each cell "attends" to others, even across spatial boundaries. The presence of high attention weights between spatially distant but transcriptionally similar cells reinforces the model’s ability to integrate global context in cell classification.
\subsection*{7.2 Scaling, Optimization, and Outlook}

We are currently scaling our training pipeline to process the \textbf{entire MERFISH dataset}, enabling the model to generalize across a broader spectrum of spatial arrangements and rare cell phenotypes. To support this, we have integrated \textbf{Optuna}, a state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization framework, which replaces earlier manual tuning with a reproducible, data-driven approach. This optimization enables fine-grained control over parameters such as learning rate, attention head count, and embedding dimensionality, making the model more adaptable to large-scale spatial omics tasks.

To further contextualize the advantages of Spatial-TransformerGNN, we compare its architectural features and modeling capacity to SpaGCN, one of the most widely cited baselines in spatial transcriptomics. While SpaGCN employs shallow GCN layers and relies on fixed spatial adjacency, our approach introduces a bilevel Transformer-GNN structure capable of learning adaptive adjacency matrices informed by both spatial and molecular signals. Additionally, our model separates spatial and gene expression encoding using dedicated modules, enabling more expressive feature representations. These are fused through transformer attention layers that model both short-range and long-range dependencies.

In terms of training objectives, SpaGCN uses only a cross-entropy classification loss, while Spatial-TransformerGNN leverages both cross-entropy and contrastive loss to enhance feature separability in the latent space. This is particularly valuable in high-class-count datasets where transcriptional distinctions may be subtle.

From a scalability perspective, SpaGCN is designed for moderate-sized datasets and region-level tissue segmentation. In contrast, SpatialTransformerGNN is optimized for large-scale, single-cell resolution analysis, demonstrated through its application to a dataset of over 2.8 million cells. The interpretability of our model is also higher, as attention maps and learned graph structures reveal biologically meaningful patterns not captured by static graphs.

Given these distinctions, a focused benchmarking study against SpaGCN is not only appropriate but essential to quantify the gains introduced by transformer-based modeling and adaptive graph learning. This comparison will help validate our approach and determine its relative advantages in real-world biological scenarios such as rare cell-type detection, tissue domain recovery, and cross-tissue inference.

Ultimately, these scaling efforts and benchmarking plans aim to establish SpatialTransformerGNN as a robust, scalable, and interpretable solution for next-generation spatially informed modeling tasks in biomedical research.

\section*{8. Discussion}

Our findings suggest that integrating global transformer attention with local GNN reasoning yields significant improvements in spatial cell classification. By combining positional encoding, expression profiling, and adaptive attention, the SpatialTransformerGNN architecture is able to model both local interactions and non-local dependencies—an essential requirement in the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data.

Traditional GNNs often struggle with limited receptive fields, as their message-passing schemes typically rely on fixed-hop neighborhoods that may not capture biologically meaningful, long-range cellular interactions. Our approach overcomes this limitation through the use of transformer-based multi-head self-attention and learned adjacency matrices, which dynamically adapt the graph topology based on both spatial and transcriptional features. This enables the model to discover relationships that are missed by static graphs, such as those between spatially distant yet transcriptionally similar immune cells.

The learned attention maps and adjacency matrices provide not only predictive strength but also interpretability. Visualizations of these matrices reveal clusters and interaction patterns that align with known biological structures, suggesting that the model is capable of uncovering spatial domain structures without explicit prior annotations. This offers promise for use in hypothesis generation and biological discovery tasks, where annotated data may be sparse or unavailable.

Importantly, the contrastive learning strategy embedded in the model helped enhance feature separation in the latent space, allowing the network to distinguish between subtle subtypes within a high-dimensional gene expression manifold. This technique proves particularly beneficial for identifying rare or underrepresented cell types—an ongoing challenge in spatial omics research.

Overall, the architecture's ability to integrate both spatial layout and expression profile into a cohesive framework makes it well-suited for complex tissue environments, where proximity does not always equate to functional similarity.

\section*{9. Conclusion}

SpatialTransformerGNN introduces a novel framework for modeling spatial transcriptomics by uniting the local structural modeling strengths of graph neural networks with the global contextual awareness of transformers. This hybrid architecture addresses key limitations in existing models by enabling flexible, data-driven learning of long-range interactions.

Our results on the Zhuang-ABCA-1 MERFISH dataset demonstrate that the model achieves strong performance while providing biologically interpretable outputs. The use of contrastive learning enhances cell-type separability in the embedding space, and the learned attention and adjacency matrices reveal context-aware relationships that static graphs often miss.

By integrating spatial structure and molecular features into a unified learning framework, Spatial-TransformerGNN advances the state of spatial omics modeling and opens the door to more powerful, interpretable, and extensible analysis pipelines in spatial biology.
